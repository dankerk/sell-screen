# To do / some comments

I've never used Redux in React before so I was hoping I could get way with not using it.
Now the state is not persisted and quantities are reset when you add new products to the cart. :'(

Watched a short tutorial on Redux for react and wanted to implement a reducer for the sale, but I'm getting a CORS error on the post request. So I didn't finish that implementation.
Hopefully you get the idea of where it was headed. 
Turns out that Redux for react is very simpel and I should have used it from the start.

Wouldn't normally use strings for action types, used strings to make faster progress.

Use styled components so styles don't leak
Fix `remove button` style
Would map server response model to local model

Configure typescript for tests
